- Full description: If the Android SDK is not set up properly on the user's 
environment, certain Cordova commands such as 'info' that depends on the 
Android SDK will error out with an unhelpful message. The message for the
info command should be modified with a more helpful message to guide the 
user to fix their Android SDK setup.
